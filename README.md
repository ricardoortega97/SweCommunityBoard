## Notes

Chanlleges: 
- Aligning the cards to adjust the size when the user changes the size of the window where the first row changes size but the next row was the same size.
- Adding animations to make the transition smoother when the user scrolls the first time. 
- Applyiing z-index property on the banner for the text and the image blend in together as a stack and sdjust the size.
- Used ChatGTP for minior assistance with CSS styling/recomendations and to explain how certain codes work on the ones that I did not understand well
